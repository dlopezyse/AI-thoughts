| Geoffrey Hinton | I recently realized that the kind of digital intelligence weâ€™re developing might be a better form of intelligence than what biological brains have. I always used to think that deep learning was trying to mimic the brain, but that it wasnâ€™t as good as the brain and we could make it better by making it more like the brain. But now I think AI systems may be doing some things more efficiently than the brain.|
| Geoffrey Hinton | With a digital system, you can have many, many copies of the exact same model of the world. These copies can work on different hardware. Thus, different copies can analyze different data. And all these copies can instantly know what the others have learned. They do this by sharing, but we cannot do that with the brain. Our minds have learned to function individually.|
| Geoffrey Hinton | I think it's quite conceivable that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence. We created an immortal form of digital intelligence that might be shut off on one machine to bring it under control. But it could easily be brought back to life on another machine if given the proper instructions. And it may keep us around for a while to keep the power stations running. But after that, maybe not. So the good news is we figured out how to build beings that are immortal. But that immortality, is not for us.|
